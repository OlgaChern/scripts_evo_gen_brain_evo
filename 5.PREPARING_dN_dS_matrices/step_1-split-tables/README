MAKE SURE that result files have only , as separators! because, when you use <paste file_1 file_2> it splits files with a tab!!!

use the below code to substitute tabs with commas

for i in results-*max_llh-tree_*; do sed -i 's/\t/,/g' $i; done


in this folder run:
./script-collect-per-LCA.sh

then in each of 
tables_for_all_6222_genes/part_1/dN/
tables_for_all_6222_genes/part_1/dS/
tables_for_all_6222_genes/part_2/dN/
tables_for_all_6222_genes/part_2/dS/


run 
python script-prepare-split-files.py
